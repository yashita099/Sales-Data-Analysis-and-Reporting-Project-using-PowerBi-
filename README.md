----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## PROBLEM STATEMENT :-

- E-commerce platforms generate massive volumes of transactional data daily. Analyzing this data is essential to understanding sales trends, identifying profit drivers,        and    improving decision-making. This project aims to derive actionable insights from sales data to boost performance and identify areas for improvement.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## OBJECTIVE :-
  
The primary objective of this project is to analyze e-commerce sales data to:
1) Identify key sales trends across different regions, categories, and time periods.
2) Understand the profit contribution of various sub-categories.
3) Highlight customer purchasing behavior and payment preferences.
4) Recommend actionable strategies to maximize profit and customer satisfaction.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## DATASET DESCRIPTION :-
The dataset used for this project includes:
  1) Fields: State, Customer Name, Product Category, Sub-Category, Payment Mode, Amount, Profit, Quantity, and Date.
  2) Metrics Analyzed:
  3) Total Sales Amount: 438K
  4) Total Profit: 37K
  5) Total Quantity Sold: 5,615
  6) Average Order Value (AOV): 121K
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

## TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES :-
  1) Data Visualization Tool: Microsoft Power BI
  2) Technologies: Power Query for data cleaning and preparation, DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for creating metrics and measures.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATION :-
  1) Ensured no missing or inconsistent values in critical fields like Amount and Profit.
  2) Standardized categorical data (e.g., State names and Payment Modes).
  3) Aggregated data for regional and temporal analysis.
  4) Removed outliers impacting profit and sales trends.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ANALYSIS PERFORMED :-
 
*1) Regional Sales Performance:*
- Maharashtra contributed the highest sales.
- Top-performing states were highlighted based on revenue.


*2) CATEGORY AND SUB-CATEGORY ANALYSIS:*
- Clothing accounted for 63% of total quantity sold.
- Printers and Bookcases generated the highest profit.


*3) PAYMENT PREFERENCES:*
- Cash on Delivery (COD) was the most preferred payment mode (44%), followed by UPI (21%).


*4) MONTHLY TRENDS:*
- January and February had the highest profits, whereas May witnessed losses.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   
## INSIGHTS AND FINDINGS :-
  1) High Revenue Areas: Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh dominate sales.
  2) Top Products: Printers and Bookcases are major profit contributors.
  3) Customer Behavior: Clothing is the most purchased category, while COD dominates payment methods.
  4) Seasonal Trends: Profits peak in Q1 but dip in mid-year months like May.

## VISUALIZATIONS :-
  
1) KEY VISUALIZATIONS INCLUDE:
- Bar charts for state-wise sales and customer-wise revenue.
- Pie charts for category and payment mode distribution.
- Line charts for monthly profit trends.
- Sub-category profit analysis using horizontal bars.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   
## CHALLENGES FACED :-
  1) Data preprocessing was time-intensive due to missing and inconsistent values.
  2) Balancing insights for both high-level trends and granular details was challenging.
  3) Identifying reasons for profit dips required additional external research on seasonal sales trends.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   
## IMPACT OR VALUE ADDED :-
  1) Improved understanding of customer behavior and payment preferences.
  2) Clear roadmap for optimizing sales and profit strategies.
  3) Enhanced decision-making through actionable insights from interactive Power BI dashboards.

## CONCLUSION :-
- The E-commerce Sales Analysis project successfully highlighted critical insights into sales performance, customer preferences, and profit-driving factors. Key findings 
  show that Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh are top-performing regions, while clothing is the most purchased category.
- Printers and Bookcases emerged as the most profitable sub-categories, and Cash on Delivery remains the dominant payment method.
- The analysis also revealed seasonal trends, with profits peaking in Q1 and declining in mid-year months like May.
- These insights can guide strategic decision-making, enabling businesses to focus on high-performing regions, promote profitable products, and optimize operations during 
  low-performing periods.
